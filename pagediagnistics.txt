Forced reflow
A forced reflow occurs when JavaScript queries geometric properties (such as offsetWidth) after styles have been invalidated by a change to the DOM state. This can result in poor performance. Learn more about forced reflows and possible mitigations.Unscored

Preconnected origins
preconnect hints help the browser establish a connection earlier in the page load, saving time when the first request for that origin is made. The following are the origins that the page preconnected to.

Preconnect candidates
Add preconnect hints to your most important origins, but try to use no more than 4.
